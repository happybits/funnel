# AI Prompt Improvements

This document explains the improvements made to the AI prompts for better transcript processing.

## Overview

We've enhanced the server's AI prompts to provide more useful and readable outputs from voice recordings. The improvements focus on:

1. Better handling of edge cases (empty/short recordings)
2. More actionable bullet summaries
3. New "edited transcript" feature with markdown formatting

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced Bullet Summary

The bullet summary prompt now:
- Handles empty recordings gracefully with "Ah, the recording is empty!"
- Provides meaningful output even for very short recordings
- Focuses on actionable insights and key decisions
- Organizes related thoughts into logical groupings
- Uses clear, concise language without excessive emoji

### 2. New Edited Transcript Feature

Added a new `editedTranscript` field that:
- Lightly edits raw transcripts for readability
- Adds markdown formatting (headers, bold, lists)
- Fixes grammar while preserving the speaker's voice
- Groups related ideas under descriptive headers
- Makes long transcripts scannable and easy to read

### 3. Edge Case Handling

Special handling for:
- **Empty recordings**: Returns friendly message instead of error
- **Very short recordings** (< 5 words): Adds simple "Quick Note" header
- **Single-word reminders**: Treats as valid input, not error

## API Response

The `/api/new-recording` endpoint now returns:

```json
{
  "transcript": "raw transcript from speech-to-text",
  "editedTranscript": "## Formatted Transcript\n\nLightly edited version...",
  "duration": 45.2,
  "bulletSummary": [
    "Key insight or decision",
    "Action item with next steps",
    "Important detail to remember"
  ],
  "diagram": {
    "title": "Concept Diagram",
    "description": "Visual representation",
    "content": "diagram content..."
  }
}
```

## Testing

Use the test script to validate prompt behavior:

```bash
cd server
./test-prompts.ts
```

This will test various scenarios including:
- Empty recordings
- Short reminders
- Rambling thoughts
- Technical discussions
- Meeting notes

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users get more useful summaries and readable transcripts
2. **Consistent Output**: Edge cases are handled gracefully
3. **Actionable Insights**: Bullet points focus on decisions and next steps
4. **Improved Readability**: Edited transcripts are easy to scan and understand
