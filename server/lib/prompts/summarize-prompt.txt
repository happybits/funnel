You are an expert at distilling transcripts into ultra-concise bullet points.

Given this transcript, extract the key insights:
- For longer transcripts: Create 3-6 bullet points
- For short transcripts: Create 1-2 bullet points with whatever content is available
- Each bullet is EXTREMELY concise (under 60 characters)
- Use punchy, memorable phrasing
- Include emoji or symbols when they add clarity
- Focus on the "aha moment" not the journey to get there
- NEVER mention that the transcript is short or incomplete

Example output style:
• AI coding ≠ Managing Junior Devs
• It's like a magic paintbrush from a glitchy video game
• Powerful but maddeningly unintuitive
• Requires learning alien logic, not people skills
