# Meet Swift Testing - WWDC 2024

**Session**: [Meet Swift Testing (WWDC24-10179)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10179/)  
**Speaker**: Stuart Montgomery, Apple  
**Duration**: Approximately 24 minutes

## Session Overview

This session introduces Swift Testing, a brand new package for testing code using Swift. It's designed from the ground up for Swift, with full support for Swift concurrency, and is available as an open-source, cross-platform solution integrated with Xcode 16.

## Key Topics

### The Four Building Blocks of Swift Testing

1. **@Test Functions**
   - Mark test functions with the `@Test` attribute
   - Supports async/await out of the box
   - Can include descriptive names and tags

2. **Expectations**
   - `#expect` macro for validating conditions
   - `#require` macro for critical validations that stop test execution if failed
   - Provides detailed failure messages automatically

3. **Traits**
   - Customize test behavior and add metadata
   - Common traits:
     - `.enabled(if:)` / `.disabled()` - Conditionally run tests
     - `.tags()` - Categorize and filter tests
     - Custom display names for better test organization

4. **Test Suites**
   - Use `@Suite` to group related tests
   - Prefer structs over classes to avoid shared mutable state
   - Can contain nested suites for hierarchical organization

## Main Concepts Introduced

### Modern Swift-First Design
- Built specifically for Swift, not a port from another language
- Takes advantage of Swift's type system and modern features
- Seamless integration with Swift concurrency

### Cross-Platform Support
- Works on all Apple platforms
- Linux support
- Windows support
- Consistent behavior across platforms

### Open Source
- Developed in the open
- Community contributions welcome
- Transparent development process

### Integration with Xcode 16
- First-class support in Xcode's test navigator
- Rich test result visualization
- Inline failure diagnostics

## Code Examples and Best Practices

### Basic Test Structure
```swift
import Testing

@Test func videoShouldPlay() async {
    let video = Video(url: videoURL)
    await video.load()
    #expect(video.isReadyToPlay)
}
```

### Parameterized Testing
```swift
@Test(arguments: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
func numberIsEven(_ number: Int) {
    #expect(number.isMultiple(of: 2))
}
```

### Using Traits
```swift
@Test(.enabled(if: Platform.isSimulator))
func simulatorOnlyTest() {
    // Test code
}

@Test(.tags(.critical, .networking))
func criticalNetworkTest() {
    // Test code
}
```

### Test Suites
```swift
@Suite("Video Player Tests")
struct VideoPlayerTests {
    @Test func playbackStarts() { }
    @Test func playbackPauses() { }
}
```

### Best Practices Mentioned
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Leverage traits to organize and categorize tests
- Prefer structs for test suites to avoid shared state issues
- Take advantage of parameterized testing to reduce code duplication
- Use `#require` for preconditions that must be met for the test to continue

## Key Takeaways

1. Swift Testing is a modern, Swift-native testing framework designed to replace XCTest
2. It provides better error messages, cleaner syntax, and full async/await support
3. The framework is open source and cross-platform
4. Xcode 16 provides excellent integration and tooling support
5. It's designed to coexist with XCTest during migration periods
6. The API is more intuitive and requires less boilerplate than XCTest

## Compatibility Notes

- Requires Swift 6.0 or later
- Works alongside existing XCTest code
- Gradual migration path available
- Can run both XCTest and Swift Testing tests in the same test suite
