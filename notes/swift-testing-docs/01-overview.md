# Swift Testing Overview

Swift Testing is Apple's modern testing framework that provides a more expressive and powerful alternative to XCTest. It's designed to leverage Swift's modern language features and make testing more intuitive and efficient.

## Key Features

### Clear and Expressive API
- Uses macros for a clean, declarative syntax
- The `#expect` macro captures and displays evaluated values, making debugging easier
- More intuitive than XCTest's assertion-based approach

### Parameterized Testing
- Run the same test with multiple inputs
- Reduces code duplication
- Makes test coverage more comprehensive

### Swift Concurrency Integration
- Seamlessly works with async/await
- Native support for testing asynchronous code
- No need for expectations or callbacks like in XCTest

### Parallel Execution by Default
- Tests run in parallel automatically
- Significantly faster test execution
- Better utilization of multi-core processors

## Benefits Over XCTest

1. **Modern Swift Integration**: Built specifically for Swift with full language feature support
2. **Better Diagnostics**: `#expect` macro provides detailed failure information
3. **Flexible Organization**: Use tags, groups, and subgroups instead of rigid class hierarchies
4. **Trait System**: Customize test behavior with traits for runtime conditions
5. **Cross-Platform**: Works on Apple platforms, Linux, and Windows
6. **Open Source**: Community-driven development and transparency

## Platform Support

Swift Testing offers comprehensive platform coverage:
- **Apple Platforms**: iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, visionOS
- **Linux**: Full support for server-side Swift development
- **Windows**: Complete Windows platform support
- **Open Source**: Available as part of the Swift open source project

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- Xcode 16 beta or later
- Swift 5.10 or later

### Migration Strategy
- Swift Testing is fully compatible with existing XCTest suites
- You can incrementally migrate tests
- Both frameworks can coexist in the same project

### Basic Example

```swift
import Testing

@Test("Continents mentioned in videos", arguments: [
    "A Beach",
    "By the Lake", 
    "Camping in the Woods"
])
func mentionedContinents(videoName: String) async throws {
    let videoLibrary = try await VideoLibrary()
    let video = try #require(await videoLibrary.video(named: videoName))
    #expect(video.mentionedContinents.count <= 3)
}
```

## Key Concepts

### Traits
Custom test behaviors that allow you to:
- Specify runtime conditions (device type, OS version)
- Control test execution
- Add metadata to tests

### Test Organization
- **Tags**: Categorize tests across different files and targets
- **Groups**: Organize related tests together
- **Subgroups**: Create hierarchical test structures

### Rich Result Presentation
- Inline display of test results in Xcode
- Detailed failure information
- Visual representation of test data

## Tooling Integration

### Xcode Integration
- Full IDE support with test navigator
- Rich inline result displays
- Integrated debugging experience

### Xcode Cloud
- Automatic test runs in CI/CD
- Parallel execution across devices
- Comprehensive test reports

### Command Line
- Swift Package Manager integration
- Run tests via `swift test`
- Suitable for CI/CD pipelines
