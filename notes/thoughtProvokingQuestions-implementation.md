# Thought-Provoking Questions Implementation

**Date**: 2025-07-09

## Overview
Fixed failing iOS tests by implementing the missing `thoughtProvokingQuestions` feature across the server and iOS client.

## Changes Made

### Server-Side Implementation
1. **Added AI Generation Function** (`server/lib/anthropic.ts`)
   - Created `generateThoughtProvokingQuestions()` method
   - Uses existing prompt at `lib/prompts/idea-exploration-prompt.txt`
   - Returns 3 thought-provoking questions per recording

2. **Updated Data Models**
   - `ProcessedRecording` interface: Added `thoughtProvokingQuestions: string[]`
   - `NewRecordingResponse` type: Added `thoughtProvokingQuestions: string[]`

3. **Modified API Endpoints**
   - `/api/recordings/:recordingId/done` (finalize-recording): Now generates questions
   - `/api/new-recording`: Now generates questions for direct file uploads

### iOS Client Updates
- `ProcessedRecording` struct: Added `thoughtProvokingQuestions: [String]` property

### Test Fixes
- Updated server tests to include the new field in mock data
- Resolved iOS test compilation errors

## Result
All compilation errors fixed. Integration tests may still fail due to simulator issues, but the core functionality is complete and models are synchronized between server and client.
