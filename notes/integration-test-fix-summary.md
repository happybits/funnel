# Integration Test Fix Summary

## Date: July 9, 2025

## Issue
The AudioUploadClientIntegrationTests were failing with "No transcript available" errors when running against the local development server.

## Root Cause
The tests were generating synthetic audio data (a 440Hz sine wave) instead of using real speech audio. When this audio was sent to Deepgram for transcription, it produced no transcript because sine waves don't contain any recognizable speech.

## Investigation Process
1. Checked server logs and found errors: `Error finalizing recording: Error: No transcript available`
2. Discovered the server was receiving audio but Deepgram wasn't generating any transcript
3. Found that tests were using `generateTestAudioData()` which created a simple sine wave
4. Located the actual sample audio file in the project: `sample-recording-mary-had-lamb.m4a`

## Solution
Updated the tests to use the real audio sample file instead of synthetic data:

1. **Fixed server URL**: Updated tests to use `Constants.API.localBaseURL` instead of hardcoded port
2. **Updated audio source**: Modified all test methods to use the actual `sample-recording-mary-had-lamb.m4a` file
3. **Added file path resolution**: Created `getSampleAudioURL()` method to locate the audio file
4. **Added audio conversion**: Created `loadSampleAudioData()` to convert the m4a file to PCM format for streaming

## Files Modified
- `/FunnelAITests/AudioUploadClientIntegrationTests.swift` - Updated to use real audio instead of sine wave

## Key Changes
- Replaced `generateTestAudioData()` calls with `loadSampleAudioData()`
- Added proper file path resolution for test environment
- Added AVAudioFile conversion to handle m4a to PCM conversion
- Fixed server URL to use Constants instead of hardcoded value

## Result
Individual tests now pass when using real audio that contains actual speech, allowing proper validation of the full audio processing pipeline including:
- Audio streaming to server
- Deepgram transcription
- AI processing (summaries, diagrams, questions)
- Response validation

## Lessons Learned
- Integration tests should use realistic test data that matches production scenarios
- Audio processing tests specifically need real speech audio, not synthetic waveforms
- Always verify test data is appropriate for the system being tested
